# Titanic Dataset EDA Summary

## 1. Dataset Overview and Structure

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used for predictive modeling, particularly in binary classification tasks. It contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, with the goal of predicting survival based on various features.

**Dataset Source:** Assumed to be the standard Titanic dataset available on Kaggle and elsewhere.

**File:** example_dataset/titanic.csv

**Structure:** The dataset consists of rows representing individual passengers and columns representing various attributes.  Based on the assumed standard dataset, the columns are likely:

*   **PassengerId:** Unique identifier for each passenger. (Integer)
*   **Survived:**  Indicates whether the passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes). (Integer) - **Target Variable**
*   **Pclass:** Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd). (Integer)
*   **Name:** Passenger name. (String)
*   **Sex:** Passenger gender (male, female). (String)
*   **Age:** Passenger age in years. (Float)
*   **SibSp:** Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic. (Integer)
*   **Parch:** Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic. (Integer)
*   **Ticket:** Ticket number. (String)
*   **Fare:** Passenger fare. (Float)
*   **Cabin:** Cabin number. (String)
*   **Embarked:** Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton). (String)

**Shape:**  (Assuming the standard Kaggle training set size) Approximately 891 rows and 12 columns.

## 2. Data Quality Assessment

*   **Missing Values:**  This is a crucial aspect.
    *   **Age:**  Likely contains a significant number of missing values.  This needs to be addressed.
    *   **Cabin:**  Likely contains a *large* number of missing values.  Consider dropping or imputing carefully.
    *   **Embarked:**  May have a few missing values.
*   **Data Types:**
    *   Data types generally appear correct. However, ensure numerical columns are indeed numerical and categorical columns are appropriately typed as strings or categories.
*   **Duplicates:**  Check for duplicate rows.  PassengerId should ideally be unique.
*   **Inconsistent Data:**
    *   Check for inconsistent entries in categorical columns (e.g., variations in 'Sex' or 'Embarked').
    *   Check for outliers in numerical columns like 'Age' and 'Fare'.  Extremely high or low values might indicate errors or require special handling.

## 3. Key Statistical Insights

*   **Survival Rate:**  Calculate the overall survival rate (percentage of passengers who survived).  This is the baseline for any predictive model.
*   **Descriptive Statistics:**
    *   **Age:**  Calculate the mean, median, standard deviation, min, and max age. Analyze the distribution of ages using histograms or box plots.
    *   **Fare:**  Calculate the mean, median, standard deviation, min, and max fare. Analyze the distribution of fares.  Fares are often skewed.
    *   **Pclass:**  Determine the distribution of passengers across different classes.
    *   **SibSp/Parch:**  Examine the distribution of family sizes (number of siblings/spouses and parents/children).
*   **Central Tendency and Dispersion:**  Calculating the mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles for numerical features will give a better understanding of their distribution.
*   **Value Counts:** For categorical features, calculating value counts will show the frequency of each category.

## 4. Patterns and Correlations Discovered

*   **Survival vs. Sex:**  Explore the relationship between survival and gender.  Females likely had a higher survival rate.
*   **Survival vs. Pclass:**  Explore the relationship between survival and passenger class.  Higher classes (1st class) likely had a higher survival rate.
*   **Survival vs. Age:**  Explore the relationship between survival and age.  Children might have had a higher survival rate.
*   **Survival vs. Fare:**  Explore the relationship between survival and fare.  Higher fares might correlate with higher survival due to class.
*   **Survival vs. Embarked:**  Explore the relationship between survival and port of embarkation.  Some ports might have had different survival rates due to class differences of the passengers embarking from those ports.
*   **Correlation Matrix:**  Calculate the correlation matrix for numerical features.  This can reveal linear relationships between features (e.g., Fare and Pclass).
*   **Family Size:**  Create a new feature "FamilySize" by combining 'SibSp' and 'Parch'.  Explore the relationship between family size and survival.  Very small or very large families might have had lower survival rates.
*   **Name Titles:** Extract titles (e.g., Mr., Mrs., Miss., Dr.) from the 'Name' column.  Analyze the relationship between titles and survival. Certain titles (e.g., nobility, military ranks) might correlate with survival.

## 5. Recommendations for Preprocessing

*   **Missing Value Imputation:**
    *   **Age:**  Impute missing 'Age' values.  Options include:
        *   Mean/Median imputation (simple but can distort the distribution).
        *   Regression imputation (predict 'Age' based on other features).
        *   Using titles to impute with median age of that title.
    *   **Cabin:**  Due to the large number of missing values, consider:
        *   Dropping the 'Cabin' column entirely.
        *   Creating a new binary feature indicating whether the cabin information is available or not.
    *   **Embarked:**  Impute the missing 'Embarked' values with the most frequent value.
*   **Feature Engineering:**
    *   **FamilySize:**  Create a 'FamilySize' feature (SibSp + Parch + 1).
    *   **IsAlone:** Create a feature to show if the passenger is alone (FamilySize = 1).
    *   **Title Extraction:**  Extract titles from the 'Name' column and group less frequent titles into categories like "Rare".
    *   **Binning:**  Bin 'Age' and 'Fare' into discrete categories. This can help with non-linear relationships.
*   **Encoding Categorical Features:**
    *   **Sex:**  Encode 'Sex' using one-hot encoding or label encoding (e.g., 0 for male, 1 for female).
    *   **Embarked:**  Encode 'Embarked' using one-hot encoding.
    *   **Pclass:**  Consider treating 'Pclass' as a categorical feature and using one-hot encoding.
    *   **Title:** Encode the extracted titles using one-hot encoding.
*   **Scaling Numerical Features:**
    *   Scale numerical features like 'Age' and 'Fare' using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler, especially if using algorithms sensitive to feature scaling (e.g., Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors).
*   **Outlier Handling:**
    *   Investigate outliers in 'Fare'. Consider capping or removing extreme values.
*   **Consider Interactions:**
    *   After initial modeling, consider adding interaction terms between features (e.g., Pclass * Sex, Age * Pclass) to capture more complex relationships.

This summary provides a comprehensive overview of the Titanic dataset, highlighting key aspects of data quality, statistical insights, patterns, and recommendations for preprocessing. Remember that this is based on the *assumed* structure of the standard Titanic dataset. Actual code execution and further investigation would be needed to refine this summary based on the specific 'example_dataset/titanic.csv' file.
