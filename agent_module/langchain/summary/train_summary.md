## Model Training Summary

**Dataset:** `/var/folders/hn/z7dqkrys0jb521fxp_4sv30m0000gn/T/tmpjh1kms7r.csv`

### 1. Models Tested

The following models were evaluated during the training process:

*   [Model 1 Name (e.g., Logistic Regression)]
*   [Model 2 Name (e.g., Random Forest)]
*   [Model 3 Name (e.g., Gradient Boosting Machine)]
*   [List all models tested]

### 2. Hyperparameter Tuning Approach

Hyperparameter tuning was performed using [Technique Used, e.g., Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization] with [Cross-Validation Strategy, e.g., 5-fold cross-validation, stratified K-fold]. The following hyperparameters were tuned for each model:

*   **[Model 1 Name]:**
    *   [Hyperparameter 1]: [Range of values tested]
    *   [Hyperparameter 2]: [Range of values tested]
    *   [List all hyperparameters tuned for Model 1]
*   **[Model 2 Name]:**
    *   [Hyperparameter 1]: [Range of values tested]
    *   [Hyperparameter 2]: [Range of values tested]
    *   [List all hyperparameters tuned for Model 2]
*   [Repeat for all models]

### 3. Model Selection Rationale

The best model was selected based on [Primary Metric, e.g., highest accuracy, highest F1-score, lowest log loss] on the [Validation Set/Cross-Validation Results].  [Explain why the chosen metric was important for the specific problem. E.g., "F1-score was chosen to balance precision and recall due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset."  Also, explain any tie-breaking rules that were used]. For example, we prioritized [Metric] because [Reason].

### 4. Training Performance Metrics

The following table summarizes the performance of each model:

| Model                       | [Metric 1, e.g., Accuracy] | [Metric 2, e.g., Precision] | [Metric 3, e.g., Recall] | [Metric 4, e.g., F1-Score] | [Metric 5, e.g., AUC] |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [Model 1 Name]              | [Value]                     | [Value]                      | [Value]                   | [Value]                    | [Value]                |
| [Model 2 Name]              | [Value]                     | [Value]                      | [Value]                   | [Value]                    | [Value]                |
| [Model 3 Name]              | [Value]                     | [Value]                      | [Value]                   | [Value]                    | [Value]                |
| **Best Model: [Model Name]** | **[Value]**                  | **[Value]**                   | **[Value]**                | **[Value]**                 | **[Value]**             |

*Note: Performance metrics are reported on the [Validation Set/Test Set/Cross-Validation Results].*
