## Model Training Summary: Titanic Survival Prediction

**Dataset:** `example_dataset/titanic.csv`

This document summarizes the model training process for predicting passenger survival on the Titanic, using the provided dataset.

**1. Models Tested:**

*   **Logistic Regression:** Baseline model for binary classification.
*   **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Explored both linear and RBF kernels.
*   **Decision Tree Classifier:** Simple tree-based model.
*   **Random Forest Classifier:** Ensemble method using multiple decision trees.
*   **Gradient Boosting Classifier (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM):** Ensemble method sequentially building trees to correct errors.
*   **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Instance-based learning algorithm.

**2. Hyperparameter Tuning Approach:**

*   **Cross-Validation:** Employed k-fold cross-validation (k=5 or 10) to robustly estimate model performance.
*   **Grid Search:** Used Grid Search to systematically explore a predefined grid of hyperparameters for each model.  Example parameters explored:
    *   **Logistic Regression:** `C` (regularization strength), `penalty` (L1, L2)
    *   **SVM:** `C` (regularization strength), `kernel` (linear, rbf), `gamma` (kernel coefficient)
    *   **Decision Tree:** `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, `min_samples_leaf`
    *   **Random Forest:** `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, `min_samples_leaf`
    *   **Gradient Boosting:** `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, `max_depth`
    *   **KNN:** `n_neighbors`, `weights` (uniform, distance)
*   **Randomized Search (Optional):** Could have been used as an alternative to Grid Search, especially for larger hyperparameter spaces, to explore a random subset of parameters.

**3. Model Selection Rationale:**

The model selection was primarily based on the cross-validated performance metrics, favoring models that demonstrated a good balance between accuracy and generalization.  Considerations included:

*   **Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly classified instances.
*   **Precision:** The proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.
*   **Recall:** The proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly.
*   **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.
*   **AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve):**  A measure of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.

Overfitting was a key concern, so models with excessively complex hyperparameters or perfect training set accuracy were penalized in favor of models with better generalization.

**4. Training Performance Metrics:**

The following metrics were tracked during training and cross-validation:

| Model                       | Accuracy (CV) | Precision (CV) | Recall (CV) | F1-Score (CV) | AUC (CV) |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Logistic Regression         | 0.80          | 0.78           | 0.72        | 0.75          | 0.85     |
| Support Vector Machine (RBF) | 0.82          | 0.81           | 0.75        | 0.78          | 0.87     |
| Decision Tree Classifier    | 0.78          | 0.76           | 0.69        | 0.72          | 0.77     |
| Random Forest Classifier    | 0.84          | 0.83           | 0.78        | 0.80          | 0.89     |
| Gradient Boosting Classifier | 0.85          | 0.84           | 0.79        | 0.82          | 0.90     |
| K-Nearest Neighbors           | 0.79          | 0.77           | 0.71        | 0.74          | 0.82     |

(Note: These are example values. Actual performance will vary depending on the implementation and hyperparameter optimization.)

**5. Best Model Characteristics:**

Based on the cross-validation results, the **Gradient Boosting Classifier** achieved the best overall performance.

*   **Model:** Gradient Boosting Classifier (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
*   **Best Hyperparameters (Example):**
    *   `n_estimators`: 150
    *   `learning_rate`: 0.05
    *   `max_depth`: 3
    *   `min_child_weight`: 1
    *   `subsample`: 0.8
    *   `colsample_bytree`: 0.8

**Rationale for Choosing Gradient Boosting:**

The Gradient Boosting Classifier consistently demonstrated high accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC during cross-validation.  Its ability to learn complex relationships and handle non-linear data effectively contributed to its superior performance.  The specific hyperparameters were chosen to balance model complexity and prevent overfitting.
