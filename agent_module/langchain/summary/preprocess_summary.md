## Preprocessing Rationale for Titanic Dataset (example_dataset/titanic.csv)

This document summarizes the rationale behind the preprocessing steps applied to the Titanic dataset (`example_dataset/titanic.csv`). The goal of preprocessing is to clean, transform, and prepare the data for effective analysis and machine learning model training.

**1. Preprocessing Steps Taken:**

Based on common practices for the Titanic dataset, the following preprocessing steps are generally considered:

*   **Handling Missing Values:**
    *   **Age:** Imputation using a method like mean, median, or more sophisticated techniques like regression imputation.
    *   **Cabin:**  Often dropped due to a high percentage of missing values or simplified to a categorical variable indicating presence/absence of cabin information.
    *   **Embarked:** Imputation using the mode (most frequent value).

*   **Feature Engineering:**
    *   **Title Extraction:** Extracting titles (Mr., Mrs., Miss., Master.) from the 'Name' feature to create a new categorical feature.
    *   **Family Size:** Combining 'SibSp' (number of siblings/spouses aboard) and 'Parch' (number of parents/children aboard) to create a 'FamilySize' feature.
    *   **IsAlone:** Creating a binary feature indicating whether the passenger was traveling alone.

*   **Data Type Conversion:**
    *   Converting categorical features like 'Sex', 'Embarked', and the newly created 'Title' into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
    *   Ensuring numerical features are of appropriate data types (e.g., integer or float).

*   **Feature Scaling (Optional):**
    *   Applying scaling techniques like standardization (Z-score) or Min-Max scaling to numerical features. This is particularly important for algorithms sensitive to feature scaling (e.g., KNN, SVM, Neural Networks).

*   **Dropping Irrelevant Features:**
    *   'PassengerId', 'Ticket', and potentially 'Name' (after title extraction) are often dropped as they typically don't contribute directly to predictive power.

**2. Rationale for Each Decision:**

*   **Missing Age Imputation:**
    *   *Rationale:* Missing 'Age' values can significantly reduce the dataset size if rows with missing values are simply dropped. Imputation allows us to retain these rows and potentially improve model performance.  A simple imputation using mean/median allows the model to still use the age feature. More sophisticated methods are used if there's reason to believe the missingness is not random.
    *   *Impact:* Introduces bias if the missing 'Age' values are not Missing At Random (MAR).  The method chosen for imputation impacts the distribution of the 'Age' feature.

*   **Dropping/Simplifying Cabin:**
    *   *Rationale:*  A large proportion of missing 'Cabin' values makes imputation unreliable. Dropping the feature avoids introducing significant noise. Simplifying to presence/absence can capture some potential signal related to passenger class.
    *   *Impact:*  Loss of potentially valuable information if the 'Cabin' number correlates with survival. However, the noise introduced by unreliable imputation could be worse.

*   **Embarked Imputation:**
    *   *Rationale:* 'Embarked' has very few missing values. Imputing with the mode is a simple and reasonable approach.
    *   *Impact:* Minimal impact due to the small number of imputed values.

*   **Title Extraction:**
    *   *Rationale:* Titles often correlate with social status, age, and gender, which can influence survival.  Extracting titles allows the model to capture these relationships.
    *   *Impact:*  Creation of a potentially strong predictive feature. Simplification of the 'Name' feature to its most important aspect for prediction.

*   **Family Size/IsAlone:**
    *   *Rationale:*  The number of family members aboard can influence survival.  These features combine related information into more meaningful features.
    *   *Impact:*  Creation of features that might be more predictive than 'SibSp' and 'Parch' individually.

*   **Data Type Conversion:**
    *   *Rationale:* Machine learning models typically require numerical input.  Categorical features need to be converted to numerical representations.
    *   *Impact:*  Allows the model to process categorical information.  The choice of encoding method (one-hot vs. label) can impact model performance and interpretation.

*   **Feature Scaling:**
    *   *Rationale:* Some algorithms are sensitive to the scale of input features. Scaling ensures that features contribute equally to the model's learning process.
    *   *Impact:* Can improve the performance of certain algorithms.

*   **Dropping Irrelevant Features:**
    *   *Rationale:* Features like 'PassengerId' and 'Ticket' are unique identifiers and are unlikely to have any predictive power.  'Name' can be dropped after title extraction.
    *   *Impact:* Simplifies the dataset and reduces the risk of overfitting.

**3. Impact on Data Quality:**

*   **Improved Data Completeness:** Imputation reduces the number of missing values, allowing for a larger dataset to be used for training.
*   **Enhanced Feature Representation:** Feature engineering creates new features that may be more informative than the original features.
*   **Data Suitability for Modeling:** Data type conversion ensures that the data is in a format that machine learning models can process.
*   **Potential Bias Introduction:** Imputation introduces bias if the missing data is not Missing At Random (MAR).
*   **Information Loss:** Dropping features can lead to a loss of potentially valuable information.

**4. Recommendations for Next Steps:**

*   **Evaluate Imputation Methods:** Compare different imputation methods for 'Age' (e.g., mean, median, regression imputation) to determine the best approach for minimizing bias and maximizing model performance.  Consider using Multiple Imputation if possible.
*   **Explore Cabin Feature:** Investigate if there's a way to extract more information from the 'Cabin' feature (e.g., deck information) before dropping it completely.
*   **Feature Selection:** Use feature selection techniques (e.g., Recursive Feature Elimination, SelectKBest) to identify the most relevant features for prediction and remove any redundant or irrelevant features.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Thoroughly evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC) on a held-out test set.
*   **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation to get a more robust estimate of model performance.
*   **Consider Interactions:** Explore interaction effects between features (e.g., interaction between Sex and Pclass) to potentially improve model performance.
*   **Documentation:**  Maintain detailed documentation of all preprocessing steps and the rationale behind them. This is crucial for reproducibility and understanding the model's behavior.

By carefully considering the rationale behind each preprocessing step and evaluating its impact on data quality, we can ensure that the Titanic dataset is properly prepared for effective analysis and machine learning model training.
