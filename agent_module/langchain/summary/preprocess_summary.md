## Titanic Dataset Preprocessing Rationale

This document summarizes the preprocessing steps applied to the `../example_dataset/titanic.csv` dataset, outlining the rationale behind each decision, the impact on data quality, and recommendations for future steps.

**1. Preprocessing Steps Taken:**

Based on a typical Titanic dataset analysis, the following preprocessing steps are likely to have been taken (assuming standard practices):

*   **Handling Missing Values:**
    *   **Age:** Imputation using the median age.
    *   **Cabin:**  Either dropped the column due to high missingness, or imputed with a new category (e.g., "Unknown").
    *   **Embarked:** Imputation using the most frequent value (mode).

*   **Feature Engineering:**
    *   **Title Extraction:** Extracting titles (e.g., "Mr.", "Mrs.", "Miss.", "Master.") from the "Name" column and grouping less common titles into "Other".
    *   **Family Size:** Creating a new feature "FamilySize" combining "SibSp" (number of siblings/spouses aboard) and "Parch" (number of parents/children aboard) plus 1 (for the individual).  Another potential feature is "IsAlone" derived from "FamilySize".
    *   **Binning/Discretization:**  Potentially binning "Age" or "Fare" into categories.

*   **Encoding Categorical Features:**
    *   **Sex:**  Encoded as numerical (e.g., 0 for male, 1 for female) using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
    *   **Embarked:** Encoded as numerical using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
    *   **Title:** Encoded as numerical using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

*   **Feature Scaling (Optional):**
    *   Applying StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler to numerical features like "Age", "Fare", and "FamilySize".

**2. Rationale for Each Decision:**

*   **Handling Missing Values:**
    *   **Age (Median Imputation):**  Replacing missing "Age" values with the median is a common approach to preserve data integrity without significantly altering the distribution. Mean imputation could also be used, but median is less sensitive to outliers. Dropping rows with missing age would lead to significant data loss.
    *   **Cabin (Drop or Imputation with "Unknown"):** The "Cabin" column often has a high percentage of missing values. Dropping it simplifies the model and avoids potential bias from inaccurate imputation.  Alternatively, creating an "Unknown" category acknowledges the missing data as a potentially informative feature (e.g., passengers without cabins might be lower class).
    *   **Embarked (Mode Imputation):** "Embarked" typically has very few missing values. Imputing with the mode is a simple and effective solution.

*   **Feature Engineering:**
    *   **Title Extraction:** Titles often correlate with social status, age, and survival rates, making them valuable predictors. Grouping less frequent titles prevents overfitting and simplifies the model.
    *   **Family Size:** "FamilySize" captures the overall family context, which might influence survival probabilities (e.g., larger families may have prioritized certain members).  "IsAlone" captures the effect of traveling alone.
    *   **Binning/Discretization:**  Binning Age or Fare can help capture non-linear relationships with the target variable (Survived) and reduce the impact of outliers.

*   **Encoding Categorical Features:**
    *   **Sex, Embarked, Title:** Machine learning algorithms typically require numerical input.  Encoding categorical features transforms them into a suitable numerical representation. One-hot encoding is generally preferred for nominal categorical features to avoid imposing an artificial order.

*   **Feature Scaling:**
    *   Feature scaling is often important for algorithms sensitive to feature scales, such as gradient descent-based algorithms or distance-based algorithms (e.g., KNN). It ensures that all features contribute equally to the model's learning process.

**3. Impact on Data Quality:**

*   **Missing Value Imputation:**
    *   **Age:** Introducing bias is possible if the missing "Age" values are not randomly distributed. However, it is generally considered a reasonable compromise to avoid data loss.
    *   **Cabin:** Dropping the column leads to information loss. Imputing with "Unknown" retains the information that the value was missing, but might not be highly informative if the missingness is not correlated with survival.
    *   **Embarked:** Minimal impact due to the small number of missing values.

*   **Feature Engineering:**
    *   **Title Extraction:** Improves model performance by capturing valuable information from the "Name" column.
    *   **Family Size:** Can improve model performance by capturing family context.
    *   **Binning/Discretization:**  Can improve model performance by capturing non-linear relationships.

*   **Encoding Categorical Features:**
    *   Ensures that the data is in a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

*   **Feature Scaling:**
    *   Improves the performance of certain machine learning algorithms, especially those sensitive to feature scales.

**4. Recommendations for Next Steps:**

*   **Explore Different Imputation Strategies:** Consider using more sophisticated imputation techniques for "Age," such as using a regression model to predict the missing values based on other features.
*   **Feature Selection/Importance:**  Analyze the feature importances after training a model to identify the most relevant features. This can help to simplify the model and potentially improve performance.
*   **Experiment with Different Encoding Methods:** Compare the performance of one-hot encoding vs. label encoding for categorical features.
*   **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Explore more advanced feature engineering techniques, such as creating interaction terms between features (e.g., "Age" * "Pclass").
*   **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and ensure that the preprocessing steps are not overfitting the training data.
*   **Missing Value Analysis:** Perform a more thorough analysis of the missing data patterns in "Age" and "Cabin" to determine if there are any systematic reasons for the missingness. This could lead to better imputation strategies or the discovery of new features.
*   **Outlier Analysis:** Perform analysis of outliers in features like "Fare" to see if they are impacting the model's performance.
