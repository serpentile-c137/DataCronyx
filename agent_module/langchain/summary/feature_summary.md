## Feature Engineering Summary - Titanic Dataset

This document summarizes the feature engineering steps performed on the Titanic dataset (`example_dataset/titanic.csv`) to improve model performance in predicting passenger survival.

**1. New Features Created:**

*   **Title:** Extracted passenger titles (e.g., Mr., Mrs., Miss., Master.) from the `Name` feature.  This captures social status and gender information, which are correlated with survival.
*   **FamilySize:** Created by summing `SibSp` (siblings/spouses aboard) and `Parch` (parents/children aboard). This feature represents the total family size of a passenger.
*   **IsAlone:** A binary feature (0 or 1) derived from `FamilySize`.  It indicates whether a passenger was traveling alone (`FamilySize` == 1).
*   **Age_band:** Discretized the `Age` feature into age bands or categories using `pd.cut`. This handles missing values and reduces the impact of outliers in the age variable.
*   **Fare_Per_Person:** Calculated by dividing `Fare` by `FamilySize + 1`. This gives a per-person fare accounting for family members.
*   **Cabin_Letter:** Extracted the first letter of the `Cabin` feature (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C').  This aims to capture the location/deck of the cabin, which may be correlated with survival. Missing `Cabin` values were handled by assigning a default value (e.g., 'Unknown' or 'Missing').
*   **Age_na_ind:** Indicator feature to mark missing values of `Age` as 1.

**2. Feature Selection Rationale:**

*   **Rationale for including Engineered Features:** The new features are designed to capture relationships and patterns in the data that are not directly available in the original features. For example, `FamilySize` and `IsAlone` provide a more comprehensive view of family dynamics than `SibSp` and `Parch` individually. `Title` and `Cabin_Letter` are expected to capture social and location information respectively.
*   **Rationale for Original Features:**
    *   `Pclass` (Passenger Class): A proxy for socioeconomic status, strongly correlated with survival.
    *   `Sex`:  A strong predictor of survival (women and children were prioritized).
    *   `Age`:  Important factor, especially for children.  Imputation was used to handle missing values.
    *   `Fare`:  Another proxy for socioeconomic status.
    *   `Embarked`: Port of embarkation.  May be correlated with survival due to socioeconomic or geographic factors.

*   **Features Dropped:**
    *   `PassengerId`: Unique identifier, not relevant for prediction.
    *   `Name`: Redundant after extracting `Title`.
    *   `Ticket`:  Generally considered difficult to interpret and not highly predictive without extensive feature engineering.
    *   `SibSp` and `Parch`: Replaced by `FamilySize` and `IsAlone`.
    *   `Cabin`: After extracting `Cabin_Letter`, the original feature is dropped, but Cabin_Letter is retained to capture useful information.

**3. Expected Impact on Model Performance:**

*   **Improved Accuracy:** By creating features that better represent underlying patterns and relationships, the model is expected to achieve higher accuracy in predicting survival.
*   **Better Generalization:** The new features, especially those related to family size and social status, may improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
*   **Reduced Overfitting:** Discretizing `Age` and other continuous variables can help to reduce the risk of overfitting.

**4. Feature Importance Insights (Hypothetical - Based on general understanding of the dataset):**

After training a model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), feature importance analysis is typically performed to understand which features contributed most to the model's predictions.  Based on prior experience and common knowledge of the Titanic dataset, the following insights are expected:

*   **High Importance:**
    *   `Sex`: Consistently a highly important feature.
    *   `Title`: Closely related to gender and social status.
    *   `Pclass`: Strong indicator of socioeconomic status.
    *   `Age`: Important, especially for children.
    *   `Fare`: Another indicator of socioeconomic status.
*   **Moderate Importance:**
    *   `FamilySize`: Captures family dynamics.
    *   `IsAlone`: Related to survival probability.
    *   `Embarked`: Port of embarkation can have some influence.
    *   `Cabin_Letter`: Location on the ship might be relevant.
*   **Lower Importance:**
    *   `Age_band`: After Age is already in the model, discretization into Age_band might be redundant and hence have less importance.
    *   `Age_na_ind`: Indicator for missing Age values.

*Note:* Actual feature importance will depend on the specific model used and the training data.  This is a prediction based on typical results.
